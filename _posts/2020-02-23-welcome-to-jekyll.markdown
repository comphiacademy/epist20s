Welcome to the epistemology course! At least for the first few weeks, we will hold our classes online. Please follow the steps below to set up the online course environment before you start. It should take less than 3 minutes.

1. Choose an email address for the communications of this course. 
2. Go to www.huiyizhuo.com and register using the email you chose in step 1.
3. Send me your chosen email address using your university email to 6687@cnu.edu.cn . 
4. Once I receive your email, I will send you an invitation to www.huiyizhuo.com. Accept the invitation on the website.

That's it! You are ready to go. Our first class is scheduled on Feb 26 1:30 - 3:00pm. We will use [piazza](http://www.piazza.com) as our course discussion forum. I will talk about how to use it during the class.
